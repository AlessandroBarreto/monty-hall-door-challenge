## The Monty Hall Problem: A Statistical Illusion

The Monty Hall problem hit the headlines in 1990, when Craig F. Whitaker of Columbia, Maryland, asked Marilyn vos Savant: ‘Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the other doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, ”Do you want to pick door No. 2?”’ Is it to your advantage to take the switch?’
